# URL Shortener using Aspire
This project was created so I can experiment with the .NET Asper

Essentially what I wanted to create was the following:

- A simple front-end
- A SQL Lite Database
- Redis for Cache (TBA)
- 

# Technologies / Libraries
- .NET 8
- Blazor
- Aspire
- SQL Lite
- Redis

# How to run

From Root folder
```sh
cd URLShortenAspire.AppHost
dotnet run
```
