# URL Shortener using Aspire
This project was created so I can experiment with the .NET Aspire

Essentially what I wanted to create was the following:

- A simple front-end
- A backend api
- A PostgreSQL Database
- Redis Cache

# Technologies / Libraries
- .NET 8
- Blazor
- Aspire
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

# How to run

From Root folder
```sh
cd URLShortenAspire.AppHost
dotnet run
```
